## Accessing Trackers

On the top navigation bar, click the **Trackers** button or visit [neptureon.com/trackers](https://neptureon.com/trackers).

You'll see 10 buttons representing each social media platform we currently track:

- **X** (formerly Twitter)
- **TikTok**
- **YouTube**
- **Instagram**
- **Facebook**
- **Truth Social**
- **Farcaster**
- **Reddit**
- **LinkedIn**
- **Publications**

Click on any platform to access its dedicated trackers page.

## Platform-Specific Tracker Pages

After selecting a social media platform, you'll be taken to that platform's dedicated tracker page, which displays a comprehensive list of all accounts we track for that particular social media.

### Search and Discovery

At the top of the page, you'll find a **search bar** that allows you to quickly look up specific accounts by their name, username, or other identifiers.

### Sorting Options

You can sort the account list by various criteria:
- **Follower Count** - View accounts ordered by their audience size
- **7-Day Post Activity** - Sort by most active accounts
- **Alphabetical Order** - Sort by account name
- **Priority Levels** - Sort by assigned priority
- And more sorting options to help you find relevant accounts

### Filtering Accounts

Click the **Show Filters** button to access advanced filtering options:
- **Follow Status** - Filter by accounts you're already following or not following
- **Follower Count** - Filter by minimum/maximum follower thresholds
- **7-Day Post Activity** - Filter by posting frequency
- **Verification Status** - Show only verified or unverified accounts
- **Priority Levels** - Filter by priority classifications
- Additional platform-specific filters

These powerful search, sort, and filter tools make it easy to discover and manage accounts that match your specific interests.

### Account Information Displayed

Each tracked account shows the following details:

#### Basic Information
- **Display Name** - The account's public display name
- **Username** - The account's unique handle or username
- **Verified Status** - Indicates whether the account is verified by the platform

#### Statistics
- **Followers** - Current follower count for the account
- **7-Day Activity** - The number of posts published in the last 7 days

#### Additional Details
- **Affiliation** - For certain platforms like Twitter/X, accounts may show their political or organizational affiliation
- **Other Platform-Specific Metadata** - Different social media platforms may display additional relevant information unique to their ecosystem

This comprehensive view allows you to quickly assess account activity, reach, and relevance before deciding which accounts to track in your personalized feed.

## Following Accounts

To start tracking an account, simply click the **Follow** button on the account's card. Once you follow an account, their posts will appear in your main feed.

To stop tracking an account, click the **Unfollow** button on any account you're currently following.

You can follow as many accounts as you want across all platforms. This allows you to create a fully customized feed tailored to your interests and information needs.

### Bulk Actions

For managing multiple accounts at once, you have several options:

**Bulk Select** - When enabled, you can:
- Select multiple accounts simultaneously
- Follow or unfollow your selected accounts with a single action
- Efficiently manage large groups of accounts

**Follow All** - Instantly follow all accounts displayed on the current platform

**Unfollow All** - Instantly unfollow all accounts you're currently following on the platform

These features are especially useful when you want to quickly manage multiple accounts from the same category, topic area, or entire platform.

## Priority Levels

After following an account, a priority level button will appear next to the unfollow button. This allows you to set how prominently that account's posts appear in your feed.

### Priority 0 (Regular)

- Posts appear with no sound notification
- Standard color in feed
- **Hidden content**: Deleted tweets, follow/unfollow activity, and profile updates are filtered out
- **Content filters apply**: Posts are subject to keyword filters (e.g., YouTube keyword filters)
- Best for: General accounts you want to follow without interruption

### Priority 1 (Medium)

- Posts appear in **bright yellow**
- **Sound notification** on new posts
- Shows all activity types: posts, follows, profile updates
- **Bypasses all content filters** - receive all posts regardless of keywords
- Best for: Important accounts you want to be notified about

### Priority 2 (High)

- Posts appear in **bright red with glow effect**
- **Repeating loud alarm sound**
- **Pauses the feed** until you manually resume
- **Bypasses all content filters** - receive all posts regardless of keywords
- Maximum priority for critical accounts
- Best for: Mission-critical accounts that require immediate attention

### Setting Priority Levels

**Individual Accounts**: After following an account, click the priority level button next to the unfollow button to open a dropdown menu where you can select the desired priority level.

**Bulk Priority Assignment**: You can also set priority levels for multiple accounts at once using the **Bulk Select** feature.

## Pagination

By default, only a certain number of accounts are displayed per page. At the bottom of the page, you'll find pagination controls that allow you to navigate between different pages to view more accounts.

The total number of accounts tracked for the platform is also displayed at the bottom, giving you a clear view of the complete scope of available accounts.

## Suggesting New Accounts

Don't see an account you want to track? You can request to have it added.

### How to Suggest an Account

1. Click the **Suggest Account** button at the top right of the page
2. Input the profile link of the account you want us to track
3. Click **Submit**

### Review Process

- **Current process**: Manual review (automated approval may be implemented in the future)
- **Review time**: Maximum 24 hours, but usually much faster
- **Approval likelihood**: Account additions are handled liberally - suggestions will almost certainly be added
- **Platform considerations**:
  - For most social media platforms, suggestions can be expected to be accepted
  - For Twitter/X, slightly more attention is paid due to strict platform limits, but requests are still generally accommodated

After submitting, check back in a few hours and the requested account will most likely already be added and available to follow.

## Filter Settings

Some social media platforms offer additional filter settings that allow fine-grained control over which content appears in the feed. These settings can be accessed via the **Filter Settings** button at the top right of the page.

### YouTube Caption Keyword Filtering

For YouTube accounts, caption keyword filtering can be enabled to ensure only videos containing specific keywords are sent to the feed.

When this filter is enabled, videos that appear in the feed will display the matched keywords along with clickable timestamps. These timestamps link directly to the specific second in the video where the keyword appears, allowing quick navigation to relevant content.

#### How It Works

1. Navigate to **Filter Settings** at the top right
2. Enable caption keyword filtering
3. Upon enabling, default keywords are automatically assigned across four categories:
   - **Crypto** - Cryptocurrency and blockchain-related terms
   - **Tech** - Technology and software topics
   - **Animals** - Animal and wildlife content
   - **Custom** - User-defined keywords

#### Customizing Keywords

**Removing Keywords**: Any default keyword can be removed from the Crypto, Tech, or Animals categories if it doesn't match the desired content

**Adding Custom Keywords**: Custom keywords can only be added to the **Custom** category. The Crypto, Tech, and Animals categories only support removal of existing keywords, not addition of new ones.

**Reset to Default**: The Crypto, Tech, and Animals categories each have a "Set to Defaults" button that:
- Resets that specific category to the current default keywords
- Keeps other categories unchanged (custom modifications are preserved)
- Updates to the latest trending keywords periodically maintained by the platform
- Useful when default keywords are updated to reflect current trends

**Example**: If keywords were removed from the Animals category and custom keywords were added to the Custom category, resetting Crypto to defaults will only affect the Crypto category - Animals and Custom category modifications remain intact.

### Publications Keyword Filtering

For Publications, keyword filtering can be enabled to ensure only articles containing specific keywords in their **title or body** are sent to the feed.

The keyword management system works the same as YouTube caption filtering, with the same four categories (Crypto, Tech, Animals, Custom) and customization options.

#### Sports Filter

A **Sports Filter** can be enabled to exclude all sports-related content from the feed. When enabled, sports articles will not be sent to the feed.

#### Filter by Source

The **Filter by Source** option allows exclusion of specific publication sources.

**Default Excluded Sources**: Some sources are excluded by default (e.g., thesun.co.uk). Articles from these sources will not appear in the feed.

**Adding Exclusions**: Additional sources can be excluded by inputting the domain (e.g., bbc.com)

**Removing Exclusions**: Any excluded source, including default ones, can be removed to allow content from that source

**Reset to Defaults**: Clicking "Set to Defaults" will:
- Reset the excluded sources list to the current defaults
- Remove all custom source exclusions that were added

## Not Sure What to Configure?

If unsure about what accounts to track, what filters to add, or how to configure settings in general, the default settings are recommended. They are already optimized to provide useful and relevant content. Simply click "Set to Defaults" on any filter category to restore the optimized settings. These defaults are applied automatically after signing up.
