Once you sign up, you'll be taken to the **home page** where you'll see your main feed.

## Default Tracking Settings

When you first sign up, Neptureon automatically sets you up with **default tracking settings**. These are accounts considered valuable and useful today, so you'll start seeing posts right away.

You don't need to configure anything—just sign up and the posts will start flowing in immediately.

## Your Main Feed

The main feed displays real-time posts from all the accounts you're tracking across every platform. This is where you'll spend most of your time, staying up to date with the latest updates and opportunities.

## What You'll See

Neptureon tracks **posts from all social media platforms**. Beyond just posts, Twitter tracking includes:

**Twitter Tracking:**
- Posts, replies, retweets, and quote tweets
- Follow and unfollow events
- Profile picture changes
- Pinned post changes
- Website/URL changes
- Bio/description updates
- Banner picture changes

This comprehensive tracking ensures you never miss any important activity or changes from the accounts you're monitoring.

## Understanding Posts

Posts are designed to be easily digestible. Each post displays:

- **Profile picture** of the source (who posted or published)
- **Display name** of the poster
- **Verification badge** (if the poster is verified on their platform)
- **Username or website** of the poster
- **Follower count** of the account
- **Time posted** (how long ago this event occurred)
- **Link to the original post** (direct link to view on the platform)
- **Post type indicators** (reply, retweet, quote, like, or regular post)
- **Media type indicators** (text only, image, video, link, carousel)
- **Source indicators** (which platform it came from)

Symbols are used instead of text to keep posts clean and easy to scan without cluttering them with labels.

### Truncated Content

Long captions are truncated to save space. For example, publications often include entire articles. Hover over any post to see the full caption.

Carousel media with more than 4 items is also truncated. Hover over the post to view all media in the carousel.

### Post Type Indicators

Each post shows what type of interaction it is. If there's no indicator, it's a regular post:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| <img src="/images/reply.svg" alt="Reply icon" style={{width: '20px', height: '20px', filter: 'invert(1)', verticalAlign: 'middle'}} /> | **Reply** - This is a reply to another post |
| <img src="/images/retweet.svg" alt="Retweet icon" style={{width: '20px', height: '20px', filter: 'invert(1)', verticalAlign: 'middle'}} /> | **Retweet** - This is a retweet/share of another post |
| <img src="/images/quote.svg" alt="Quote icon" style={{width: '20px', height: '20px', filter: 'invert(1)', verticalAlign: 'middle'}} /> | **Quote** - This is a quote tweet with added commentary |
| <img src="/images/like.svg" alt="Like icon" style={{width: '20px', height: '20px', filter: 'invert(1)', verticalAlign: 'middle'}} /> | **Like** - The account liked another post |

### Media Type Indicators

Each post includes a symbol indicating its content type:

| Symbol | Meaning |

| <img src="/images/feather.svg" alt="Feather icon" style={{width: '20px', height: '20px', filter: 'invert(1)', verticalAlign: 'middle'}} /> | **Text Only** - Text-only post with no media |

## Feed Settings

In the top left corner, click the gear icon to open feed settings:

### Post Order

Choose how posts are displayed:

- **Live Order (Default & Recommended)** - Posts appear as received from the platform. This is recommended because different platforms have different delivery speeds. For example, X posts arrive in milliseconds while Instagram posts may have a 15-second delay. Live order keeps the newest posts at the top regardless of platform delays.

- **Chronological Order** - Posts appear based on when they were originally posted on the platform. This can cause posts to appear jumbled since platform delays vary, making it harder to track new content.

### Animations

Toggle animations on or off for when new posts arrive in the feed.

## Feed Controls

### Pause/Play Feed

Next to the settings icon, use the pause/play button to control the feed:

- **Pause** - Click to stop new posts from appearing. This allows you to view current posts without movement or interruption.
- **Play** - Click again to resume the live feed.

**Auto-Pause:** Hovering your cursor over the feed automatically activates pause mode. The feed resumes when you move your cursor away.

### Search Feed

Use the search bar to filter posts. Type any text to see only posts that contain your search term. This filters through all visible posts in the feed.

### Platform Filters

Next to the search bar are 10 buttons, each representing a different social media platform. These control which platforms you receive posts from in your feed.

- **All Active by Default** - All platforms are enabled, so you'll receive posts from every source
- **Deactivate** - Click a platform's logo to stop receiving posts from that source
- **Reactivate** - Click again to resume receiving posts from that platform

This allows you to focus on specific platforms when needed.

## Customize Tracked Accounts

To customize which specific accounts you track, visit the **Trackers** page. There you can add or remove accounts to tailor your feed to your needs.

In the next section, we'll cover how to manage your tracked accounts on the Trackers page.
