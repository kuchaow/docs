## Why the History Page?

The main feed is designed for real-time monitoring and is limited to displaying the **50 most recent posts**. When new posts arrive, older ones are automatically removed to maintain performance and prevent the website from consuming excessive resources.

This creates a few challenges:

- **Fast-moving feed**: During high-activity periods, posts can scroll by quickly
- **Missed content**: Important posts might disappear before being seen
- **Time away from screen**: Posts published while sleeping or away from the computer will almost certainly be gone by the time of return
- **No historical access**: Once a post is removed from the feed, it's gone from view
- **Constant monitoring required**: Users would need to keep their eyes on the screen to avoid missing anything

The History page solves these problems by providing access to all past posts from followed accounts, allowing exploration and search at any time without the pressure of real-time monitoring.

## Historical Posts

The **Historical Posts** sidebar allows querying posts by date range and platform.

### Platform Selector

Choose which social media platform to search (e.g., YouTube, X, Instagram, etc.)

### Priority Level Filter

Filter results by the priority levels assigned to followed accounts:

- **Toggle to enable**: When enabled, select which priority levels to include
- **Multiple selection**: Choose any combination of priority levels:
  - Regular (Priority 0)
  - Medium (Priority 1)
  - High (Priority 2)

**Examples**:
- Select only "High" to see posts from critical accounts
- Select "Medium" and "High" to exclude regular priority posts
- Select all three to see posts from all followed accounts regardless of priority

### Platform-Specific Filters

Depending on the selected platform and configured filter settings, additional filter toggles may be available:

#### YouTube
- **Apply Keyword Filters**: Only show videos matching configured keywords (only appears if caption keyword filtering is enabled in YouTube filter settings)

#### Publications
- **Apply Keyword Filters**: Only show articles matching configured keywords in their title or body (only appears if keyword filtering is enabled in Publications filter settings)
- **Exclude Sports**: Filter out sports-related articles (only appears if sports filter is enabled in Publications filter settings)
- **Exclude Sources**: Filter out articles from excluded sources (only appears if source exclusions are configured in Publications filter settings)

#### Combining Filters
All available filters can be used together in any combination. The Priority Level Filter can be combined with platform-specific filters where applicable.

**Example**: For Publications with Apply Keyword Filters and Exclude Sports enabled, results will show only articles that match keywords and are not sports-related.

### Event Type

For platforms like X/Twitter that support multiple event types, filter results by:

- **All Events** - Show all activity types
- **Posts Only** - Only display regular posts
- **Following Updates** - Track who accounts are following
- **Profile Updates** - See profile changes
- **Pinned Tweets** - View pinned tweet changes

For all other social media platforms, only "Posts Only" is available.

### Date Range

Select a custom date range to search within, with the following parameters:

- **Default**: Last 24 hours
- **Maximum range**: Up to 3 days
- **Custom range**: Choose any start and end dates within the 3-day limit

### Results Per Page

Set how many posts to display per page:

- **Maximum**: 50 posts per page
- **Pagination**: Load more results using pagination controls at the bottom of the feed

### Viewing Results

After selecting a platform, event type (if applicable), and date range, click the **Search** button. All posts from followed accounts on that platform within the specified timeframe will appear in the feed on the right.

**Example**: Selecting YouTube with the default 24-hour range will display all YouTube videos posted by followed accounts in the last 24 hours.

## Account Timeline

View posts from a single specific account on a chosen platform.

### How It Works

1. **Platform Selector**: Choose the social media platform (e.g., Instagram, X, YouTube, etc.)
2. **Platform-Specific Filters**: Available filters depend on the selected platform and configured filter settings (same as Historical Posts):
   - **YouTube**: Apply Keyword Filters toggle (if caption keyword filtering is enabled)
   - **Publications**: Apply Keyword Filters, Exclude Sports, and Exclude Sources toggles (if enabled in settings)
3. **Username Input**: Enter the username of the account to view
4. **Results Per Page**: Set how many posts to display per page (maximum 50)
5. **Search**: Click the search button to view all posts from that specific account
6. **Pagination**: Use pagination controls at the bottom to load more posts

This feature is useful for exploring the complete posting history of a single account without filtering by date or combining with other accounts.

## Search by Post URL

To quickly find a specific post, input the post's URL directly. The post will be displayed immediately without needing to configure date ranges or filters.
