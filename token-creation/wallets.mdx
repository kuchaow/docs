description: Set up and manage wallets for token deployment
---

The first step to deploying tokens is having a wallet. Neptureon currently supports **Solana** and **BSC (Binance Smart Chain)**.

## Getting Started with Wallets

### Solana Wallet

The most popular Solana wallet is **Phantom**. We recommend starting with Phantom if you don't already have a Solana wallet.

**Download Phantom:** [https://phantom.com/](https://phantom.com/)

Phantom is available as:
- Browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge)
- Mobile app (iOS and Android)

Follow Phantom's setup instructions to create your wallet and securely save your recovery phrase. Once set up, you'll need to add some SOL to cover gas fees for token deployments.

### BSC Wallet

We recommend using **MetaMask** for BSC:

**MetaMask:** [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)

MetaMask is available as:
- Browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge)
- Mobile app (iOS and Android)

Follow MetaMask's setup instructions to create your wallet and securely save your recovery phrase.

**BSC Network:**

BSC typically comes by default in MetaMask. If you don't see it in your network list, you can add it manually:

- **Network Name:** Binance Smart Chain
- **RPC URL:** https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
- **Chain ID:** 56
- **Currency Symbol:** BNB
- **Block Explorer:** https://bscscan.com

Once set up, you'll need to add some BNB to cover gas fees for token deployments.

## Managing Wallets on Neptureon

Navigate to the **Wallets** page to manage your wallets for token deployment.

### Wallet Views

The Wallets page has two views: **Solana** and **Binance**.

- **Solana View:** Displays all your Solana wallets
- **Binance View:** Displays all your Binance Smart Chain (BSC) wallets

Switch between views to see wallets for each blockchain. Only wallets for the selected blockchain will be displayed.

### Search and Sort

**Search Bar:**
Use the search bar to quickly find specific wallets by name or address.

**Sort Options:**
You can sort your wallets by various values:
- **Balance** - Sort by wallet balance (high to low or low to high)
- **Created Date** - Sort by when the wallet was created
- **Name** - Sort alphabetically by wallet name
- **Type** - Sort by wallet type (Deployer, Bundler, Sniper)

## Wallet Types

Neptureon uses different wallet types for different purposes. Understanding these types helps you organize your deployment and trading strategy.

### Deployer

**Deployer** wallets are your primary wallet for token deployments.

- **Purpose:** Used to deploy new tokens to the blockchain
- **Requirements:** Should have sufficient SOL / BNB for deployment fees
- **Limitation:** Only one deployer wallet can be set at a time

### Bundler

**Bundler** wallets are used for bundled transactions.

- **Purpose:** Enables MEV-protected transaction bundles
- **Use Case:** Ideal for coordinated trading strategies
- **Limitation:** Can have multiple bundler wallets

### Sniper

**Sniper** wallets are used for buying tokens after bundles complete.

- **Purpose:** General-purpose trading wallet
- **Use Case:** Used for all non-deployment and non-bundling functions
- **Limitation:** Can have multiple sniper wallets

### Default Wallet Type

When you add or create your first wallet (or when you have no wallets), it will automatically be set as a **Deployer** wallet.

Once there is a Deployer wallet set, all subsequent wallets you create or import will default to **Sniper** type.

You can change the wallet type at any time through the wallet settings.

## Wallet Settings

Click the **Actions** button on any wallet to access its settings:

### Rename Wallet

Change the name of your wallet to better organize your wallets (e.g., "Main Deployer", "Sniper 1", "Bundle Wallet").

### Change Wallet Type

Change the wallet type between Deployer, Bundler, or Sniper.

**Important:** Only one wallet can be set as a Deployer at a time. If you change another wallet to Deployer, the previous Deployer wallet will automatically be changed to Sniper.

### Delay (Sniper Wallets Only)

For **Sniper** wallets, the delay setting represents the time between the token deployment and buying, measured in **milliseconds**.

For example:
- **0ms** - Buy immediately after deployment
- **1000ms** - Wait 1 second after deployment before buying
- **5000ms** - Wait 5 seconds after deployment before buying

This allows you to control when your sniper wallets enter after a token is deployed.

### Buy Amount

The **Buy Amount** setting controls how much currency (SOL or BNB) the wallet will use for purchases. The meaning changes based on wallet type:

- **Deployer:** The default amount it will buy when launching the token
- **Bundler:** The amount that it will buy for the bundle
- **Sniper:** The amount it will buy when sniping

For example:
- **0.1 SOL** - Wallet will buy with 0.1 SOL
- **0.05 BNB** - Wallet will buy with 0.05 BNB

### Export Private Key

You can export the private key of any wallet created or imported on Neptureon:

1. Click the **Actions** button on your wallet
2. Select **Export Private Key**
3. Your private key will be displayed
4. Save it securely if you want to import this wallet into Phantom, MetaMask, or other wallet applications

## Security Best Practices

### Do's
- **Use separate wallets** for token deployment vs. long-term holdings
- **Keep only what you need** in deployment wallets
- **Save your recovery phrases** securely offline

### Don'ts
- **Never share** your private keys with anyone
- **Don't store large amounts** in deployment wallets
- **Don't import** wallets containing significant funds unless necessary

## Next Steps

Once your wallets are set up and configured, you're ready to activate Deployer Mode. Continue to the next section to learn how to enable Deployer Mode and start deploying tokens.
