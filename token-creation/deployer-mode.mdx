Before you can deploy tokens, you need to activate Deployer Mode. This unlocks token creation features throughout the platform.

## Enabling Deployer Mode

1. Look at the **top right corner** of the app
2. Find the **Deployer Mode toggle**
3. Click to activate it

Once enabled, Deployer Mode adds new features to your Neptureon experience.

## What Changes When Deployer Mode is Active

### Rocket Button on Posts

With Deployer Mode active, you'll see a **rocket button** appear on the right side of every post in your feed.

- Click the rocket button on any post to open the **Deploy Panel**
- The Deploy Panel contains all the settings you need to deploy a token based on that post
- This allows you to quickly deploy tokens the moment you spot an opportunity

### Deployments Page

Deployer Mode also unlocks the **Deployments page**, accessible from the main navigation.

The Deployments page is your command center for token creation:
- View the **history of all your past deployments**
- **Manage your deployed tokens**
- Track performance and status of your tokens

## Quick Deployment Workflow

With Deployer Mode active, deploying a token is fast:

1. Browse your feed as normal
2. Spot a viral post with token potential
3. Click the **rocket button** on that post
4. Configure your deployment settings in the panel
5. Deploy the token
6. Manage it later from the Deployments page

In the next section, we'll explore the Deploy Panel and learn how to configure your token deployments.
