---

The Deploy Panel is where you configure and launch your tokens. Before using it, make sure Deployer Mode is activated.

## Opening the Deploy Panel

There are several ways to open the Deploy Panel:

### Method 1: From the Main Feed (Clean Slate)

1. With Deployer Mode active, look at the **top right corner of the feed**
2. Click the **rocket symbol**
3. The Deploy Panel will open with empty values - a clean slate ready for you to configure

### Method 2: From a Post (Auto-Filled)

With Deployer Mode active, you'll see a **rocket button** on every post in both the **Main Feed** and the **History page**.

1. Navigate to the Main Feed or History page
2. Click the rocket button on any post
3. The Deploy Panel will open with certain fields **automatically filled** from the post

This works identically on both the Main Feed and History page, giving you the flexibility to deploy tokens from any post, whether it's live or from your history.

## Basic Settings

The Deploy Panel contains several fields you can configure for your token deployment.

### Required Fields

These fields are **required** for every deployment:

#### Coin Name
The full name of your token (e.g., "Doge Coin", "Pepe Token")

#### Ticker
The ticker symbol for your token (e.g., "DOGE", "PEPE")

#### Launchpad
The platform where you'll deploy the token. You must select a launchpad for deployment.

**Available Launchpads:**

**Solana:**
- **pump.fun** (Default) - The original Solana meme coin launchpad
- **bonk.fun** - Bonk-themed launchpad
- **USD1** - Bonk.fun with USD1 as the quote token instead of SOL
- **Launch Lab** - Raydium's launchpad

**BSC (Binance Smart Chain):**
- **Four Meme** - BSC meme coin launchpad

#### Media (Image)
The image that will be used for your token. You have several options:
- Select media from a post (when deploying from a post)
- Upload your own image
- Create ASCII art (see ASCII option below)

#### Amount to Buy
The amount of currency (SOL or BNB) to buy immediately upon deployment.

- **Default:** Uses the buy amount set in your Deployer wallet settings
- **Fallback:** If no amount is set in wallet settings, defaults to 0.01

### Optional Fields

These fields are optional but recommended:

#### Description
A description of your token. When deploying from a post, this is auto-filled with the post link.

#### Website
A website URL for your token.

#### Twitter
A Twitter/X URL for your token.

#### Telegram
A Telegram URL for your token.

## Auto-Fill from Posts

When you click the rocket button on a post, the Deploy Panel intelligently fills in fields based on the post:

### Twitter Posts
- **Twitter field:** Auto-filled with the Twitter post link
- **Description:** Auto-filled with the post link

### Non-Twitter Posts
- **Website field:** Auto-filled with the post link
- **Description:** Auto-filled with the post link

### Media Selection from Posts

When deploying from a post, you can select any media from that post:

- **Post images** - Any images included in the post
- **Post videos** - Any videos included in the post
- **Profile picture** - The poster's profile picture
- **Custom upload** - Upload your own image instead

Simply click on the media you want to use as your token's image.

## Media Options

You have three ways to set your token's image:

### 1. Select from Post
When deploying from a post, choose any media from the post or the poster's profile picture.

### 2. Upload Custom Image
Click the upload button to upload your own custom image from your device.

### 3. ASCII Art Generator

The ASCII option lets you create text-based art for your token image:

1. Click the **ASCII** option
2. Input your text
3. Choose from various ASCII art styles and formats
4. The generated ASCII art will be used as your token image

This is perfect for creating unique, text-based token images.

## Next Steps

Once you've configured all your settings in the Deploy Panel, you're ready to deploy your token. In the next section, we'll cover advanced settings and the actual deployment process.
